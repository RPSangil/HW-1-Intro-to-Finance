## Who is Kickstarter PBC?

Kickstarter PBC (Public Benefit Corporation), previously Kickstarter Inc., is an alternative funding platform for entrepreneurs of creative projects. Founded by Perry Chen, Yancey Stickler and Charles Adler, Kickstarter Inc was launched on 28th Aprile 2009 and in 2015 became a PBC.

According to Perry Chen, the idea for Kickstarter came about due to an opportunity that was missed due to the costs that would be involved. At the time, he had been hoping to organise a pair of DJs to perform a show in the 2002 Jazz Fest however, this show was unable to occur due to the costs that would be involved. It nagged him that the potential audience for the show had not been able to input on whether the show would occur or not. He imagined a website where people could pledge to attend a show and if enough money was pledged they would be charged and not charged if not enough was gathered. This was the basis idea for Kickstarter.

In todays economy, funds are need to launch a project or idea. If a project or idea may not result in a profit for the investor or donor, interest is often lost or support not given. Since creative projects or ideas usually have more of a cultural benefit, they may not receive as much backing and never reach actualization due to a lack of funds. Outside sources like donors and investors could demand changes or alterations to the original project to suit their own needs, resulting in compromising the original purpose or creativity of the project or idea. There is a need for creators of creative projects or ideas to receive funding without these hurdles.

Kickstarter aims at empowering creative entrepreneurs to actualize their creative projects. Creative projects from Art, Comics, Crafts, Dance, Design, Fashion, Film & Video, Food, Games, Journalism, Music, Photography, Publishing, Technology and Theatre can be pledged on the Kickstarter website as well as many sub categories. Kickstarter is a funding platform which brings these creators in contact with their audience community to encourage their audiences to fund their work.
