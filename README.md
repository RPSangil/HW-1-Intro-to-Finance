FinTech Week 1 Homework Assignment


## Alternative Finance - Crowdfunding

In todays economy, funds are need to launch a project or idea. If a project or idea may not result in a profit for the investor or donor, interest is often lost or support not given. Since creative projects or ideas usually have more of a cultural benefit, they may not receive as much backing and never reach actualization due to a lack of funds. Outside sources like donors and investors could demand changes or alterations to the original project to suit their own needs, resulting in compromising the original purpose or creativity of the project or idea. There is a need for creators of creative projects or ideas to receive funding without these hurdles. 

This is where crowdfunding comes in.

As defined on merriam-webster.com;
> *Crowdfunding is the practice of obtaining needed funding (as for a new business) by soliciting contributions from a large number of people especially from the online community.*

## Who is Kickstarter PBC?

Kickstarter PBC (Public Benefit Corporation), previously Kickstarter Inc., is an alternative finance platform for entrepreneurs of creative projects. Founded by Perry Chen, Yancey Stickler and Charles Adler, Kickstarter Inc was launched on 28th Aprile 2009 and in 2015 became a PBC. 

According to Perry Chen, the idea for Kickstarter came about due to an opportunity that was missed due to the costs that would be involved. At the time, he had been hoping to organise a pair of DJs to perform a show in the 2002 Jazz Fest however, this show was unable to occur due to the costs that would be involved. It nagged him that the potential audience for the show had not been able to input on whether the show would occur or not. He imagined a website where people could pledge to attend a show and if enough money was pledged they would be charged and not charged if not enough was gathered. This was the basis idea for Kickstarter.

Today, Kickstarter aims at empowering entrepreneurs to actualize their creative projects via reward based crowd funding. Creative projects from Art, Comics, Crafts, Dance, Design, Fashion, Film & Video, Food, Games, Journalism, Music, Photography, Publishing, Technology and Theatre can be pledged on the Kickstarter website as well as many sub categories. Kickstarter is a funding platform which brings these entrepreneurs in contact with their audience community to encourage their audiences to fund their work.

In it's initial stages, the company received some funds from friends to get up and running. These days, Kickstarter PBC applies a 5% fee to the funds collected on any successfully funded project. A third party payment partner, Stripe also processes all pledges and charge a 3-5% processing fee.

Kickstarter displays statistics updated daily with the raw data behind Kickstarter. As of 23rd March 2022:
* Total amount of launched projects was 552813,
* Total amount of Sucessfully funded projects was 217,463
* Total amont of backers was 20834903 with 7065031 being repeat backers

## Why use Kickstarter?

Kickstarter is a funding platform that allows entrepreneurs to showcase their project for funding. Some competitor platforms like Patreon allow creators to charge their audience community on a membership basis to support the creative activity on an ongoing basis. Everything on Kickstarter however, must be a project. Projects come to a clear completion and result in a product or service produced by the project. Pledgers can feel the security of knowing exactly what they are pledging towards and what the outcome of their pledge should result in.

Other crowdfunding platforms like Fundrazr or Indiegogo which support a "Keep it all / all / nothing" funding model. "Keep it all" means that as soon as a pledge is made and the funds are available, the creator has access to and can keep the funds. Kickstarter has an all or nothing funding model. When a new campaign is made on kickstarter, a funding goal is set. This funding goal is the amount that the entrepreneurs believes they will require to be able to produce the project in entirety. If the full funding goal is not met, the entrepreneurs does not receive any funds. This means that a pledgers can pledge to a Kickstarter campaign with the reassurance that they are not charged unless the campaign reaches the funding goal.
